### Objective of the game and general rules

  - **Objective:** The main goal of the game is to achieve world domination by eliminating opponents and conquering territories.
- **Setup:** Players receive a certain number of armies based on the number of territories they control. Players take turns placing their armies on the map.
- **The game:** One their turn,  players can attack enemy territories by rolling dice to determine the outcome of battles. The more armies they have in the territory they are attacking from, the more dice they roll (with a maximum of three dice). Same holds for the defender with a maximum of two dice. More specifically, to determine the outcome of a battle, we compare the highest die each of the players (attacker and defender) rolled. If the attacker's is higher, the defender loses an army from the territory under attack. Else the attacker loses an army from the territory he attacked from. If each of the players has more than one army in their territory, they roll more than one dice, so the process is repeated for the pair of dices with the second greatest values.
- **Winning:** The game continues until a player conquers all territories, eliminating opponents along the way.<br><br>
